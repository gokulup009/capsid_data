This folder contains data for the paper "Packing and Ejection Dynamics of Polymers: Role of Confinement, Polymer Stiffness, and Activity."

Folder Structure
Directories like FIGn: Contain data corresponding to Figure n from the paper.
Directories like FIGn_FIGm: Contain data corresponding to Figures n and m.
Subdirectory Structure
Inside each figure directory, you will find two subdirectories corresponding to different values of the stiffness parameter kappa:

kappa_0: Contains data for kappa = 0.
kappa_10: Contains data for kappa = 10.

Data Format
In these files, the header "mean" or "tau(mean)" represents the total translocation time. In the paperâ€™s figures, the total translocation time is plotted in units of taud.
